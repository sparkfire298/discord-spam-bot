# discord spam bot
a terrible discord spam bot i made in 10 minutes

### setup
pretty easy

- go to index.js and enter your token from the [dev portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) in the token area

- run `npm install discord.js`

- add it to a server

- run `node index.js` or whatever you named the file (`npm start` if you're lost)

### how it works
when someone sends a message, it sends 20 different spam messages

so its a spam bot because it detects its own messages causing a massive flood of @everyone pings until its rate limited or killed


### is this bannable?
~~no~~ i have no clue
